Title:  Chapter 4 - Numerical computing
Author: Nicolas P. Rougier


# Objectives

The goal of this chapter is to introduce the `numpy` and `scipy` modules that
provide a N-dimensional array object and mathematical and numerical associated
routines.  NumPy (numerical python) provides basic routines for manipulating
arrays and matrices while SciPy (scientific python) extends the functionality
of NumPy with a substantial collection of common (and not so common)
algorithms.


# Introduction

Numpy (@Oliphant:2006) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with
Python. It contains among other things:

* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
* and a lot more...

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be
defined and this allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide
variety of projects. We are going to explore numpy through a simple example,
implementing the Game of Life.

## Broadcasting rules

$$
5 \times 
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 \\3 & 4\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}5 \times 1 & 5 \times2 \\5 \times 3 & 5 \times4\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}5 & 10 \\15 & 20 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

```python
>>> M = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
>>> print(5*M)
[[ 5 10]
 [15 20]]
```

# Game Of Life

Numpy is slanted toward scientific computing and we'll consider in this section
the game of life by John Conway which is one of the earliest example of
cellular automata (see figure below). Those cellular automaton can be
conveniently considered as array of cells that are connected together through
the notion of neighbours. We'll show in the following sections implementation
of this game using pure python and numpy in order to illustrate main
differences with python and numpy.

``` {#game-of-life .python .numberLines}
Z = [[0,0,0,0,0,0],
     [0,0,0,1,0,0],
     [0,1,0,1,0,0],
     [0,0,1,1,0,0],
     [0,0,0,0,0,0],
     [0,0,0,0,0,0]]

def compute_neighbours(Z):
    shape = len(Z), len(Z[0])
    N  = [[0,]*(shape[0])  for i in range(shape[1])]
    for x in range(1,shape[0]-1):
        for y in range(1,shape[1]-1):
            N[x][y] = Z[x-1][y-1]+Z[x][y-1]+Z[x+1][y-1] \
                    + Z[x-1][y]            +Z[x+1][y]   \
                    + Z[x-1][y+1]+Z[x][y+1]+Z[x+1][y+1]
    return N

def show(Z):
    for l in Z[1:-1]:
        print(l[1:-1])
    print()

def iterate(Z):
    shape = len(Z), len(Z[0])
    N = compute_neighbours(Z)
    for x in range(1,shape[0]-1):
        for y in range(1,shape[1]-1):
            if Z[x][y] == 1 and (N[x][y] < 2 or N[x][y] > 3):
                Z[x][y] = 0
            elif Z[x][y] == 0 and N[x][y] == 3:
                Z[x][y] = 1
    return Z

show(Z)
for i in range(4):
    iterate(Z)
show(Z)
```
